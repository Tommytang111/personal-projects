# Machine Learning Practice Repository

## Description
This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks created as part of my self-practice in machine learning, as I make my transition here from Neuroscience. It serves as a collection of experiments, implementations, and notes on various machine learning techniques, algorithms, and concepts. The content is intended for personal learning and sharing insights with others who are interested in the field.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tommytang111/machine-learning.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd machine-learning-practice
   ```
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(Note: A `requirements.txt` file is included with commonly used libraries like `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`. Update it as needed.)*

## Usage
- Explore the Jupyter notebooks for detailed examples and explanations of various machine learning concepts.
- Run Python scripts in the terminal or your preferred IDE for specific implementations.

Example to run a script:
```bash
python script_name.py
```

To open Jupyter notebooks:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Content
The repository is organized into the following folders:
- `datasets/`: Example datasets used in practice.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step implementations.
- `scripts/`: Standalone Python scripts demonstrating key algorithms and techniques.
- `resources/`: Links, notes, and additional materials for learning.
Content updates will be ongoing.

## Features
- Implementation of fundamental machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees).
- Hands-on practice with popular libraries like `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`, and `PyTorch`.
- Data preprocessing and visualization techniques.
- Experimentation with real-world datasets.
